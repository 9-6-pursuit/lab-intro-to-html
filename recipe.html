    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This peanut butter & preserves sandwich is my favorite sandwich. It has the perfect balance of ingredients and looks great when made right.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of Dave's Killer bread</li>
        <li>1 jar of Kirlkland strawberry preserves</li>
        <li>1 jar of Kirlkland chunky peanut butter</li>
        <li>A butter knife</li>
        <li>A sharp knife</li>
        <li>A cutting board</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay both slices of bread next to each other on a cutting board.</li>
        <li>With the butter knife, spread a 1/8th inch layer of Kirkland peanut butter on the left side. (we buy in bulk over here as a slight way to combat the inequities of capitalism and environment destruction</li>
        <li>On the right side, spread a 1/8th inch layer of Kirkland preserves.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the two halves together so that the preserves sit on top. If you end up putting the peanut butter on top, you failed. Please discard your sandwich and start over. There is no Command+Z irl buddy.</li>
        <li>With the sharp knife, carefully cut the sandwich in half. DIAGONALLY is the only acceptable pathway. If your sandwich halves aren't triangles, you failed.</li>
    </ol>
