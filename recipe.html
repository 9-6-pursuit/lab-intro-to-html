<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Could you ever imagine a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as decadent? Try this gourmet PB&J, and you'll reassess everything you've previously understood about this classic.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 slices bread, such as rye, whole grain, or sourdough
    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter, smooth or crunchy</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon jam, or jelly, your choice of flavor</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter, for pan, plus softened butter or margarine for bread</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Prepare peanut butter sandwich using desired jelly or jam. Make sure it isn't too runny because the sandwich will be heated and jam could leak out.</li>
    <li>Heat a frying pan to melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Tilt pan so butter covers pan evenly. This is key to get a perfectly crispy crust on the bread.</li>
    <li>Butter one side of sandwich. Place buttered-side down in the pan. If possible, place a steak weight or bacon press on sandwich so it cooks evenly. When one side is golden brown, butter other side. Turn sandwich over and place weight back on sandwich. The second side will cook faster because sandwich is already heated.</li>
    <li>Remove sandwich from pan, cut diagonally and serve immediately.</li>
