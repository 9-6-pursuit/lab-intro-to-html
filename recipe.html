    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
            In a medium bowl, gently mix the crab meat (remove any shell bits), mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of Old Bay, bread crumbs, and parsley. Be careful not to puree the meat. Form 4 crab balls and put them on a non-stick baking sheet or aluminum foil, cook the crab meat mixture for 7-8 minutes, take it out and let it rest outside.</li>
        <li> Preparing the Old Bay topping sauce: Using a saucepan, melt a knob of butter then whisk two tablespoons of flour until uniformly mixed. Pour the whipping cream slowly into it while still whisking until the mixture is smooth. Add the mustard, a teaspoon of Old Bay & a teaspoon of 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Stir gently and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat to very low and stir every couple of minutes with the pan uncovered until thickened. </li>
        <li> In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the seasoning to the cutlets on both sides with salt and pepper before browning in the melted butter. Allow 5-7 minutes on each side for a nice brown color. The chicken should be almost cooked through, but not all the way through, it will finish cooking in the oven.

        </li>
        <li> On the previously used baking sheet, place each cutlet and place a crab mixture ball on top of each. 
            Put the whole thing back in the oven for about 10 minutes, the crab should be golden brown.</li>
        <li> Turn off the heat under the sauce skillet, let it rest and cool down until the chicken finishes cooking. If you find that the sauce is not thick enough, you can use a little potato or corn starch to thicken it (dissolve a teaspoon of cornstarch into a bit of water, add it to the sauce and stir gently until the sauce is thicker).</li>
        <li>Remove the cutlets from the oven, and place each cutlet on a plate. Pour a little sauce over each one and don't forget to garnish with a little parsley. Serve your delicious Chicken Chesapeake with your favorite side dish. </li>
