<p>The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a throwback to our collective adolescence. An indulgent snack for days when we just don't want to feel our age. Here's an adult take on this classic.</p>
<ul><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>

    <li>1/2 cup (50 g) old-fashioned rolled oats - gluten free if needed</li>
    <li>1 cup (237 ml) unsweetened almond milk
    2 tbsp (12 g) unsweetened powdered peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 tbsp (13 g) ground flax seed</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li> 1/4 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li> 1 tbsp pure maple syrup (or liquid stevia to taste)</li>
</ul>

<ol><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
    <li>Combine all ingredients (except peanut butter, jam and optional toppings) in a container that seals well. Stir with a spoon until the peanut butter powder and ground flax is completely combined and smooth. Seal the container and shake vigorously for 30 seconds.</li>

    <li>Place the sealed container in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    
    <li>To serve, give the oat mixture a good shaking or stir, then into a jar or small bowl, add half of the oats. Layer with jam, peanut butter and remaining oats. Top with additional peanut butter and jam, crushed peanuts and fresh berries if you choose. Enjoy immediately.</li>

    <li>Consume within 2 days of preparing for the best quality.</li>
