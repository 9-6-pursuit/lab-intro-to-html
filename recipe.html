<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The grilled cheese sandwich is a simple, yet delicious favorite of mine. Made with Texas Toast and your favorite cheeses, it is a masterwork of crunchy, buttery, cheesy goodness.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<li>Bread – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
<li>Butter – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
<li>Cheese – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>
<h2>Grilling The Cheese</h2>
<ol>Butter the toast – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</ol>
<ol>Heat skillet – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</ol>
<ol>Add cheese – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</ol>
<ol>Brown the toast – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</ol>
<ol>Serve – cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</ol>
