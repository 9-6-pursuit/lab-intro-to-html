<h1>Blueberry Pancakes</h1>
<p>Say goodbye to the boxed pancake mix. Everything you need to make delicious pancakes is probably sitting in your kitchen right now. This recipe is easy! The pancakes aren’t too sweet and are lightly scented with vanilla and our special secret ingredient. They are delicious and they are easily adapted to what you have in your kitchen. Let’s do this!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Flour</strong>: Use all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, or a combination of the two. For gluten-free pancakes, use your favorite gluten-free flour blend or try buckwheat flour. </li>
  <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: We use granulated sugar, but other sugars like coconut sugar, raw sugar, or brown sugar will work in the recipe.</li>
  <li><strong>Baking Powder</strong>: It is the baking powder that makes these pancakes light and fluffy.</li>
  <li><strong>Salt</strong>: We like to use 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt. It balances the sugar nicely and brings out lots of flavor in the pancakes. If you are using salted butter, consider reducing the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.</li>
  <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Whole milk, reduced-fat, and even skim milk will work in this recipe. For dairy-free pancakes, substitute non-dairy milk (like unsweetened almond milk or homemade oat milk). I’ve also used orange juice in place of the milk before and it worked nicely. </li>
  <li><strong>Melted Butter</strong>: You can’t beat the taste of butter for this, but if you need a plant-based option, melted coconut oil or melted plant-based butter work, too. We use unsalted butter, but salted butter will work as a substitute. If you do use salted butter, reduce the amount of salt by 1/4 teaspoon.</li>
  <li><strong>One Egg</strong>: The egg adds structure, flavor, and fluffiness. </li>
  <li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong>: Vanilla adds sweetness and depth of flavor. You could try other extracts, too. Almond extract would be pretty delicious.</li>
  <li><strong>A Pinch of Cinnamon</strong> is the secret ingredient that mixes with the aroma and taste of the vanilla to make your pancake recipe irresistible!</li>
