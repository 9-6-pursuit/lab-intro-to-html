<h2>Southern Peach Cobbler Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 so you can get started on other things while it warms up.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced peaches, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch—this is going to be your irresistible peach cobbler filling.</li>
        <li>Now, pour the peach mixture into a two-quart baking dish or pan and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate, medium bowl, combine the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt to create the ultimate flour mixture. Mix in the unsalted, melted butter by using your hands or pastry blender. You will want the mixture to resemble coarse meal once combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in water until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Remove the peaches from the oven and drop spoonful of the topping on top.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the white sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture on top of the peaches with the dough topping.</li>
        <li>Next, place it back into the oven and bake for an additional 30 minutes—or until golden brown!</li>
        <li>After it's done, serve it up warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Although this could just be a personal preference, I think Ice cream makes for the perfect cobbler topping each and every time!
